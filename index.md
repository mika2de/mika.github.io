## Leisure projects
- **[Automated robot vacuum cleaner garage](https://hackaday.io/project/178993-space-saving-robot-vacuum-cleaner-garage)**, an ESP8266 powered kitchen skirting board that hides the robot vacuum cleaner. Project log on hackaday.io, source code in [ecovacs-deebot-garage](https://github.com/mika2de/ecovacs-deebot-garage). You can't buy but build it. 

- **[Automated cocktail machine](https://cocktailnator.de)**, an Ardunio + Raspberry PI powered cocktail machine. My first project which utilizes micro controllers :) Rasberry PI server build with Spring Boot, frontend with AngularJs.

- Public 3D printable designs on **[thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/mika2de/designs)** 
  - My masterpiece, a peristalitik pump I designed using an open source CAD programm. The pump is intended to replace the preasure system I develop in 2014 for my cocktail machine. For more details visit my old cocktailnator blog entries.

- My tiny technical **[youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@mkai2305)** showing some of the above projects. 

- Several WordPress based websites for friends and clubs like my own **[Water protection and fishing club](https://gav-reinheim.de)** in which I work as a board member (since 2022).

- A lot of home automation mostly running on a HP server with Proxmox and RAID 1 below. Thanks to the virualization layer the installations and maintenance of e.g. Home Assistant, OctoPi, AdGuard, an nginx reverse-proxy, Nextcloud and further neat tools is dead easy.
