## My leisure projects
- **[Automated robot vacuum cleaner garage](https://hackaday.io/project/178993-space-saving-robot-vacuum-cleaner-garage)**, an ESP8266 powered kitchen skirting board that hides the robot vacuum cleaner. Project log on hackaday.io, source code in [ecovacs-deebot-garage](https://github.com/mika2de/ecovacs-deebot-garage). Before you ask, you can't buy but build it. 

- **[Automated cocktail machine](https://cocktailnator.de)**, an Ardunio + Raspberry PI powered cocktail machine. My first project which utilizes micro controllers :) Rasberry PI server build with Spring Boot, frontend with AngularJs.

- My printable 3D designs on **[thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/mika2de/designs)** A peristalitik pump I designed using an open source CAD programm and printed with my 3D printer. The pump is intended to replace the preasure system I develop in 2014 for my cocktail machine. For more details visit my old cocktailnator blog entries.
